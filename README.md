This project contains different Control flow statements exercises:

Write a method called isPalindrome with one int parameter called number.
The method needs to return a boolean.
It should return true if the number is a palindrome number otherwise it should return false.

Write a method named sumFirstAndLastDigit with one parameter of type int called number.
The method needs to find the first and the last digit of the parameter number passed to the method, using a loop and return the sum of the first and the last digit of that number.
If the number is negative then the method needs to return -1 to indicate an invalid value.


Write a method named getEvenDigitSum with one parameter of type int called number.
The method should return the sum of the even digits within the number.
If the number is negative, the method should return -1 to indicate an invalid value.


Write a method named hasSharedDigit with two parameters of type int. 
Each number should be within the range of 10 (inclusive) - 99 (inclusive). If one of the numbers is not within the range, the method should return false.
The method should return true if there is a digit that appears in both numbers, such as 2 in 12 and 23; otherwise, the method should return false.


Write a method named hasSameLastDigit with three parameters of type int. 
Each number should be within the range of 10 (inclusive) - 1000 (inclusive). If one of the numbers is not within the range, the method should return false.
The method should return true if at least two of the numbers share the same rightmost digit; otherwise, it should return false.


Write a method named getGreatestCommonDivisor with two parameters of type int named first and second. 
If one of the parameters is < 10, the method should return -1 to indicate an invalid value.
The method should return the greatest common divisor of the two numbers (int).
The greatest common divisor is the largest positive integer that can fully divide each of the integers (i.e. without leaving a remainder).


Write a method named printFactors with one parameter of type int named number. 
If number is < 1, the method should print "Invalid Value".
The method should print all factors of the number. A factor of a number is an integer which divides that number wholly (i.e. without leaving a remainder).
For example, 3 is a factor of 6 because 3 fully divides 6 without leaving a remainder. In other words 6 / 3 = 2.


What is the perfect number?
A perfect number is a positive integer which is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors.
Proper positive divisors are positive integers that fully divide the perfect number without leaving a remainder and exclude the perfect number itself.
For example, take the number 6:
Its proper divisors are 1, 2, and 3 (since 6 is the value of the perfect number, it is excluded), and the sum of its proper divisors is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. 
Therefore, 6 is a perfect number (as well as the first perfect number).
	Write a method named isPerfectNumber with one parameter of type int named number. 
	If number is < 1, the method should return false.
	The method must calculate if the number is perfect. If the number is perfect, the method should return true; otherwise, it should return false.


Write a method called numberToWords with one int parameter named number.
The method should print out the passed number using words for the digits.
If the number is negative, print "Invalid Value".
To print the number as words, follow these steps:
1. Extract the last digit of the given number using the remainder operator. 
2. Convert the value of the digit found in Step 1 into a word. There are 10 possible values for that digit, those being 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Print the corresponding word for each digit, e.g. print "Zero" if the digit is 0, "One" if the digit is 1, and so on.
3. Remove the last digit from the number.
4. Repeat Steps 2 through 4 until the number is 0.
The logic above is correct, but in its current state, the words will be printed in reverse order. For example, if the number is 234, the logic above will produce the output "Four Three Two" instead of "Two Three Four". To overcome this problem, write a second method called reverse.
The method reverse should have one int parameter and return the reversed number (int). For example, if the number passed is 234, then the reversed number would be 432. The method  reverse should also reverse negative numbers.
Use the method reverse within the method numberToWords in order to print the words in the correct order.


Write a method named canPack with three parameters of type int named bigCount, smallCount, and goal. 
The parameter bigCount represents the count of big flour bags (5 kilos each).
The parameter smallCount represents the count of small flour bags (1 kilo each).
The parameter goal represents the goal amount of kilos of flour needed to assemble a package.
Therefore, the sum of the kilos of bigCount and smallCount must be at least equal to the value of goal. The method should return true if it is possible to make a package with goal kilos of flour.
If the sum is greater than goal, ensure that only full bags are used towards the goal amount. For example, if goal = 9, bigCount = 2, and smallCount = 0, the method should return false since each big bag is 5 kilos and cannot be divided. However, if goal = 9, bigCount = 1, and smallCount = 5, the method should return true because of 1 full bigCount bag and 4 full smallCount bags equal goal, and it's okay if there are additional bags left over.
If any of the parameters are negative, return false.


Write a method named getLargestPrime with one parameter of type int named number. 
If the number is negative or does not have any prime numbers, the method should return -1 to indicate an invalid value.
The method should calculate the largest prime factor of a given number and return it.



Write a method named printSquareStar with one parameter of type int named number. 
If number is < 5, the method should print "Invalid Value".
The method should print diagonals to generate a rectangular pattern composed of stars (*).
